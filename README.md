# stock-Price-Predction-deep-learning-


Overview

The Stock Price Predictor is a machine learning-based web application that forecasts stock prices using historical data. The application leverages Yahoo Finance (yfinance) API to fetch real-time stock data, processes it, and applies an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for predictions. The results include a time and price graph with moving averages of 50 days, 100 days, and 200 days, as well as a real price vs. predicted price graph. The predictions are displayed through an interactive web interface built with Streamlit.
